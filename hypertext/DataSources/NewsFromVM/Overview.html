<H1>CERN News groups</H1>Do not confuse CERN news with <A NAME=7 HREF=http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/News/Overview.html>Internet news</A> .The CERN internal news
system contains groups which are public, and those which are private.
You can find the public ones from the <A NAME=14 HREF=http://crnvmc.cern.ch/NEWS/?>list</A>. There are other  private
groups not mentioned there: to access them you need to know the name.
If you want to access a private group, you can do it explicitly with
the command
<XMP>		www "http://crnvmc.cern.ch./NEWS/<groupname>"

</XMP>where  is the name of your private group, or a number of groups separated
by plus signs. ("Quotes" necessary on VMS only.) You can build links
to private groups from your group home page. __________________________________________________________
