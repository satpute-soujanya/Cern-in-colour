  <h1>Change History</h1>
  Changes to the <a name="0" href="Overview.html">Mail Robot</a>, in reverse
  chronological order:
  <h2>October 1992</h2>
  TBL added information retrieval possibility using WWW. Release as an
  unsupported W3 product to those who ask for it.
  <h2>1991</h2>
  TBL rewrote str.c (used to overwrite its arguments).
  <h2>AEM</h2>
  A. E. Mossberg, aem@mthvax.cs.miami.edu made a couple minor changes, to make
  it slightly less UCSD-specific. He also added a README, and example files in
  the subdirectory example-files.
  <h2>Origin</h2>
  Note this is NOT the bitnet LISTSERV program. The term "mail robot" is yused
  to attempt to prevent confusion between these two products, which have
  different functionality although they do basically the same sort of thing.
  <p>
    This was the UCSD listserv program, which AEM retrieved from ucsd.edu by
    anonymous ftp, TBL retrieved from ftp.eff.org As retrieved, from
    file://ftp.eff.org/pub/listserv2.shar, it consisted of the following files:
    <xmp
>    README
    Makefile
    commands.c
    listserv.h
    main.c
    str.c
    subscribe.c
