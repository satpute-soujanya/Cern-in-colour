  <h1>Using the W3 mailing robot</h1>
  <a name="0" href="Overview.html">This robot</a> maintains the W3 mailing
  lists, and allows W3 documents to be retrieved on request.
  <p>
    You can subscribe or unsubscribe to any of the various WWW mailing lists by
    sending email to the robot "listserv@info.cern.ch" -- see the commands
    listed below.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any problems, requests or questions for a human being, mail
    "www-request@info.cern.ch". Lists are:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>www-announce</dt>
    <dd>
      Anyone interested in WWW, who would like information about new releases or
      new online data available. Please refrain from posting administrivia to
      this large list !
    </dd>

    <dt>www-talk</dt>
    <dd>
      Developers of WWW code, or those interested in discussions of technical
      details
    </dd>
  </dl>

  You can also find information on WWW (as well as many other things!) by
  telnetting to info.cern.ch (no username, no password).
  <p>
    If you want to pick up the WWW software, then use anonymous FTP to
    info.cern.ch and look in directory /pub/www. Subdirectories are src for the
    latest source packages, bin for executables for various machines, doc for
    "paper copies" of articles on WWW in PostScript and ASCII forms, and also
    the "WWW book" which is a compendium of the hypertext documentation of the
    project. To read the latest documentation, use WWW !
  </p>

  <h2>Commands</h2>
  The commands understood by the listserv program are:
  <dl>
    <dt>HELP</dt>
    <dd>
      lists this file. This is also sent whenever a message to listserv is
      received from which no valid command could be parsed.
    </dd>

    <dt>HELP groupname</dt>
    <dd>lists a brief description of the group requested.</dd>
    <dt>ADD listname</dt>
    <dd>Add yourself to the list</dd>
    <dt>DELETE listname</dt>
    <dd>take yourself off the list</dd>
    <dt>ADD address listname</dt>
    <dd>
      Add yourself with a given mail address to the given list. The address must
      not contain spaces!
    </dd>

    <dt>DELETE address listname</dt>
    <dd>
      Remove the given name from the given list. For all ADD/DELETE commands,
      mail is sent to the address given to confirm the add or delete operation.
    </dd>

    <dt>SEND document-address</dt>
    <dd>returns a document with the requested W3 address.</dd>
    <dt>STOP</dt>
    <dd>
      Stop processing requests: ignore the rest of the message. Needed if you
      send a signature on the end of your message (or if some gateway adds one).
      If in doubt, use it.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  A command must be the first word on each line in the message. Lines which do
  not start with a command word are ignored. If no commands were found in the
  entire message, this help file will be returned to you. A single message may
  contain multiple commands; a separate response will be sent for each.
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <xmp
>
	add www-announce

	add me@host.uni.edu www-announce

	delete me@host.uni.edu www-talk
	
	send http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html

</xmp
  >
  <h2>Subscription</h2>
  If you are not sending mail from your preferred mail address, then you can use
  the second form of the command to give your mail address. If you are not on
  the internet, please convert your address into arpa stye. (For example, UK
  users please use international ordering joe@host.ac.uk) Just speficy the
  mailbox, without any spaces.
  <p>
    If you omit the 'address' the command will assume the mailbox that is in the
    From: line of the message. Note that SUBSCRIBE is a synonym for ADD;
    UNSUBSCRIBE for DELETE.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that is IS possible to add or delete someone else's subscription
    to a mailing list. This facility is provided so that subscribers may alter
    their own subscriptions from a new or different computer account. There is
    therefore some potential for abuse; we have chosen to limit this by mailing
    a confirmation notification of any addition or deletion to the address added
    or deleted including a copy of the message which requested the operation. At
    least you can find out who's doing it to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that although you would mail submissions to a mailing list by
    addressing mail to e.g., www-talk@info.cern.ch, in a subscription request
    you specify the name of the list simply (without the @hostname part) as in
    the first example above.
  </p>

  <h2>Retrieving documents</h2>
  The SEND command (or the WWW command which is equivalent) returns the document
  with the given W3 address, subject to certain restrictions. Hypertext
  documents are formatted to 72 character width, with links numbered. A separate
  list at the end gives the document-addresses of the related documents.
  <p>
    If the document is hypertext, it links will be marked by numbers in
    brackets, and a list of document addresses by number will be appended to the
    message. In this way, you can navigate through the web, albeit only at mail
    speed.
  </p>

  <h2>CAUTIONARY NOTE</h2>
  As the robot gives potential mail access to a *vast* amount of information, we
  must emphasise that the service should not be abused. Examples of appropriate
  use would be:
  <ul>
    <li>Accessing any information about W3 itself;</li>
    <li>
      Accessing any CERN and/or physics-related or network development related
      information;
    </li>
  </ul>

  Examples of INappropriate use would be:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Attempting to retrieve binaries or .tar files or anything more than
      directory listsings or short ASCCII files from FTP archive sites;
    </li>

    <li>Reading internet newsgroups which your site doesn't take;</li>
    <li>Repeated automatic use;</li>
  </ul>

  There is currently a 1000 line limit on any returned file. We don't want to
  overload other people's mail relays or our server. We reserve the right to
  withdraw the service at any time. We are currently monitoring all use of the
  server, so your reading will not initially enjoy privacy. End of cautionary
  note.
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
